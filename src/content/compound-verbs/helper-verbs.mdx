title: Helper Verbs (کول / کېدل)
---

import {
    defaultTextOptions as opts,
    Examples,
    InlinePs,
} from "@lingdocs/pashto-inflector";
import { KidsSection, VP, KingIcon, ServantIcon } from "../../components/terms-links";
import psmd from "../../lib/psmd";
import Link from "../../components/Link";
import Formula from "../../components/formula/Formula";
import ReactPlayer from "react-player";

Pashto uses a number of helper verbs (auxillary verbs) to form compounds.

The most important ones are these four:

- Transitive
    - <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "کول", f: "kawúl", e: "to make ___ ___" }} />
    - <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "کول", f: "kawúl", e: "to do ___" }} />
- Intransitive
    - <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "کېدل", f: "kedúl", e: "to become ___" }} />
    - <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "کېدل", f: "kedúl", e: "to happen" }} />

Wait, how are these *four* verbs, and not *two*?? 🤔🤔 Don't the pairs look exactly the same? When you look at this you may feel like this lady does in this video. 

<div className="player-wrapper" style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%" }}>
<ReactPlayer
    url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YG6tlxv4eU"
    controls={true}
    width='100%'
    height='100%'
    style={{ 
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
    }}
/>
</div>
<div style={{ paddingBottom: "1rem" }}>
</div>

Yes, there really are four separate verbs. You're not seeing double, and this is not a trick. The verbs behave differently and have different meanings. And once we see them in the perfective form we will see that they really do look different too.
