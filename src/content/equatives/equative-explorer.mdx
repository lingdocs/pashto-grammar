You can use this tool to explore how to make different equative sentences. Everything that comes out of this will be **gramatically correct**, but the sentences might not always make sense! 🤪

### Equative Rules: 👨‍🏫

- The **subject** has to be a **noun phrase**
- The **predicate** can be a **noun phrase** or **compliment**
- In Pashto, if the predicate is a noun phrase, the equative agrees with the predicate. Otherwise, if the predicate is a compliment, the equative agrees with the subject. In English, the equative always agrees with the subject.
