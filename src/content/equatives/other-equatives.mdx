## Subjunctive Equative

The subjunctive equative is used to talk about something being something when the statement involves:
- a hypothetical condition
- a wish, desire, hope
- a purpose
- statement of whether it should or shouldn't be

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    psmd({
        p: "امید لرم چې خوشحاله **وي**",
        f: "Umeed larum che khosháala **wee**",
        e: "I hope he **is** happy",
    }),
]}</Examples>

<EquativeFormChoice 
    forms={{
        sentence: {
            displayForm: addToForm(
                [grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain, " ", { p: "...", f: "..." }, " "],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive,
            ),
            english: [
                ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
                ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
                ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
                ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
                ["He/she/it is ...", "They are ..."],
                ["He/she/it is ...", "They are ..."],
            ],
        },
        pure: {
            displayForm: grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive,
        },
    }}
    opts={opts}
/>

#### Purpose

The subjunctive is used in clauses that express a purpose or an aim of something being something.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "زه به درته سندره وایم، چې ته خوشحاله **وې**",
        f: "zu ba taa ta sandura waayum, che tu khoshaala **we**.",
        e: "I'll sing to you, so that you'll **be** happy.",
    },
])}</Examples>

#### Judgement/obligation

The subjunctive form can be used to talk about it being being good or bad, necessary, or required that something is something.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "هغوي باید په ښووونځي کې **وي**",
        f: "hagwee baayad pu xowoondzee ke **wee**.",
        e: "They have to be in school.",
    },
])}</Examples>

#### Desire

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "امید لرم چې هلته **وي**",
        f: "Umeed larum che halta **wee**.",
        e: "I hope they're there.",
    },
    {
        p: "هغه غواړي چې مونږ په کور کې **وو**",
        f: "haghá ghwaaRee che moonG pu kor ke **woo**.",
        e: "He wants us to be home.",
    },
])}</Examples>

#### Conditions

The subjunctive form is also used to talk about conditions or possibilities. *If A = B, then...* or *It could be that A = B ...*

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "که دوکان کې وریژې **وي** نو وایې خله",
        f: "ku dokaan ke wrejze **wee**, no waa-ye-khla",
        e: "If there's rice in the store, buy it",
    },
    {
        p: "کېدی شي چې ډوډۍ تیاره **وي**",
        f: "kedey shee che DoDúy tayaara **wee**",
        e: "The food could be ready",
    },
])}</Examples>

#### Important Note on Common Use:

This is the standard/written form of the subjunctive equative. However in many dialects you will find that people use the same forms as the <Link to="/equative/habitual-equative">habitual equative</Link> when speaking. For example:

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "هغه غواړي چې مونږ په کور کې **وو**",
        f: "haghá ghwaaRee che moonG pu kor ke **woo**.",
        e: "He wants us to be home.",
        sub: "proper / standard",
    },
    {
        p: "هغه غواړي چې مونږ په کور کې **یو**",
        f: "haghá ghwaaRee che moonG pu kor ke **yoo**.",
        e: "He wants us to be home.",
        sub: "often spoken / colloquial",
    },
])}</Examples>

- say A was B habitually/repeatedly in past
- to presume or guess about A being B in the past
- or to talk about the outcome of hypothetical conditions
- to say that A should have been B

Like the <Link to="#past-equative">past equative</Link> that it's based on, it's usually used with the short form.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={grammarUnits.baParticle} /> + <Link to="#past-equative">past equative</Link>

#### Presuming something about the past

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([

        f: "tu **ba** khabúr **we**, ka na?.",
        e: "You would have known, wouldn't you?",
    },
])}</Examples>

#### Habitual Past

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "زه **به** هر سهار هلته **وم**",
        f: "zu **ba** hăr saháar halta **wum**",
        e: "I would be there every morning",
    },
    {
        p: "زما مور **به** دلته ناسته **وه**.",
        f: "zmaa mor **ba** dalta naasta **wa**.",

#### Hypothetical outcome

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([

        e: "If I hadn't slept, I **would have been** tired.",
    },

<GameDisplay record={equativeGameWouldBe} />

## Past Subjunctive

This is used to talk about:

- If A were hypothetically B but it isn't
    - also if A *had been* hypothetically B, but it isn't
- If you wish A were B
- If A should have been B
- In prayers and blessings (in some dialects)

Because this is based on the the non-inflecting tail, *it doesn't change at all, no matter what the subject is*.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "و", f: "w" }} /> + non-inflecting tail
</Formula>
