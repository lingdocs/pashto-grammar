## Past Equative

This is used to say that something was something in the past. ("I was...")

It is usually used in the short form.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ول", f: "wul" }} /> + <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/#past-verb-endings">past verb endings</Link>
</Formula>

        sentence: {
            displayForm: addToForm([
                grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain, " ", { p: "...", f: "..." }, " "],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.past,
            ),
            english: [

            displayForm: grammarUnits.equativeEndings.past,
        },
    }}
    opts={opts}

#### Examples

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "ته چېرته **وې**؟",
        f: "tu cherta **we**?",
        e: "Where **were** you?",
    },
    {
        p: "زه په کور کې **وم**.",
        f: "zu pu kor ke **wum**.",
        e: "I **was** at home.",
    },

        f: "haghá Der stúRey **wo**.",
        e: "He **was** very tired.",

        f: "moonG khúfa **woo**.",
        e: "We **were** sad.",
    },
])}</Examples>

## Affirmative Equative

This is used:

1. To affirm or to make a strong assumption that something will have been something. ("I'll have been ...")
2. To say what would have happened if a hypothetical condition were true. ("If ..., I'd be ...")

Like the <Link to="#past-equative">past equative</Link> that it's based on, it's usually used with the short form.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={grammarUnits.baParticle} /> + <Link to="#past-equative">past equative</Link>

                    { p: "...", f: "..." },
                    " ",
                ],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.past,
            ),
            english: [
                ["I'll be ...", "We'll be ..."],
                ["I'll be ...", "We'll be ..."],

        f: "tu **ba** khabúr **we**.",
        e: "Youwill have known.",

        e: "If I hadn't slept, I **would have been** tired.",
    },
])}</Examples>

## Conterfactual / Past Subjunctive / Wish Equative

This is used to talk about something being hypothetically something, or to wish that something were something. ("If I was ...", "If only I was ..."). It is also used for prayers and blessings in some dialects.

Because this is based on the the non-inflecting tail, *it doesn't change at all, no matter what the subject is*.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "و", f: "w" }} /> + non-inflecting tail
</Formula>

export function WithTailChoice() {
    const [choice, setChoice] = React.useState("aay");
    const waay = concatPsString(
        {p: "و", f: "w"},
        choice === "aay" ? { p: "ای", f: "aay" } : { p: "ی", f: "ey" },
    );
    return (
        <div>
            <div className="text-center my-3">
                <div className="text-muted mb-1">
                    <small>The spelling/pronunciation of the non-inflecting tail can vary based on dialect</small>
                </div>
                <ButtonSelect
                    options={[
                        { label: <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ای", f: "aay" }} />, value: "aay" },
                        { label: <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ی", f: "ey" }} />, value: "ey" },
                    ]}
                    value={choice}
                    handleChange={(p) => setChoice(p)}
                />
            </div>

                            { p: "کاشکې ... ...", f: "kaashke ... ..."}, " ",
                            waay, { p: "!", f: "!" },
                        ),
                        english: [[["If only ... was/were ...!"]]],
                    },
                    pure: {
                        displayForm: waay,
                    }
                }}
                opts={opts}
            />
        </div>
    );
}

<WithTailChoice />

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
