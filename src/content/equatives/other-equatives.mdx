## Subjunctive Equative

The subjunctive equative is used to talk about something being something when the statement involves:

- a hypothetical condition
- a wish, desire, hope
- a purpose
- statement of whether it should or shouldn't be

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {[
    psmd({
      p: "امید لرم چې خوشحاله **وي**",
      f: "Umeed larum che khosháala **wee**",
      e: "I hope he **is** happy",
    }),
  ]}
</Examples>

<EquativeFormChoice
  forms={{
    sentence: {
      displayForm: addToForm(
        [grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain, " ", { p: "...", f: "..." }, " "],
        grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive
      ),
      english: [
        ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
        ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
        ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
        ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
        ["He/she/it is ...", "They are ..."],
        ["He/she/it is ...", "They are ..."],
      ],
    },
    pure: {
      displayForm: grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive,
    },
  }}
  opts={opts}
/>

#### Purpose

The subjunctive is used in clauses that express a purpose or an aim of something being something.

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "زه به درته سندره وایم، چې ته خوشحاله **وې**",
      f: "zu ba taa ta sandura waayum, che tu khoshaala **we**.",
      e: "I'll sing to you, so that you'll **be** happy.",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### Judgement/obligation

The subjunctive form can be used to talk about it being being good or bad, necessary, or required that something is something.

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "هغوي باید په ښووونځي کې **وي**",
      f: "hagwee baayad pu xowoondzee ke **wee**.",
      e: "They have to be in school.",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### Desire

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "امید لرم چې هلته **وي**",
      f: "Umeed larum che halta **wee**.",
      e: "I hope they're there.",
    },
    {
      p: "هغه غواړي چې مونږ په کور کې **وو**",
      f: "haghá ghwaaRee che moonG pu kor ke **woo**.",
      e: "He wants us to be home.",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### Conditions

The subjunctive form is also used to talk about conditions or possibilities. _If A = B, then..._ or _It could be that A = B ..._

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "که دوکان کې وریژې **وي** نو وایې خله",
      f: "ku dokaan ke wrejze **wee**, no waa-ye-khla",
      e: "If there's rice in the store, buy it",
    },
    {
      p: "کېدی شي چې ډوډۍ تیاره **وي**",
      f: "keday shee che DoDúy tayaara **wee**",
      e: "The food could be ready",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### Important Note on Common Use:

This is the standard/written form of the subjunctive equative. However in many dialects you will find that people use the same forms as the <Link to="/equative/habitual-equative">habitual equative</Link> when speaking. For example:

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "هغه غواړي چې مونږ په کور کې **وو**",
      f: "haghá ghwaaRee che moonG pu kor ke **woo**.",
      e: "He wants us to be home.",
      sub: "proper / standard",
    },
    {
      p: "هغه غواړي چې مونږ په کور کې **یو**",
      f: "haghá ghwaaRee che moonG pu kor ke **yoo**.",
      e: "He wants us to be home.",
      sub: "often spoken / colloquial",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

        grammarUnits.equativeEndings.past
      ),
    },
  }}
  opts={opts}
/>

### Examples

#### Presuming something about the past

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "ته **به** خبر **وې** که نه؟",
      f: "tu **ba** khabúr **we**, ka na?.",
      e: "You would have known, wouldn't you?",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### Habitual Past

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "زه **به** هر سهار هلته **وم**",
      f: "zu **ba** hăr saháar halta **wum**",
      e: "I would be there every morning",
    },
    {
      p: "زما مور **به** دلته ناسته **وه**.",

    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### Hypothetical outcome

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "که خوب مې نه وای کړی، زه **به** ستړی **وم**.",
      f: "ku khob me nu waay kúRay, zu **ba** stúRay **wum**.",
      e: "If I hadn't slept, I **would have been** tired.",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

<GameDisplay record={equativeGameWouldBe} />

## Past Subjunctive

This is used to talk about:

- If A were hypothetically B but it isn't
  - also if A _had been_ hypothetically B, but it isn't
- If you wish A were B
- If A should have been B
- A had to be B (it was necessary/good for A to be B)
- In prayers and blessings (in some dialects)

Because this is based on the the non-inflecting tail, _it doesn't change at all, no matter what the subject is_.

<Formula>
  <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "و", f: "w" }} /> + non-inflecting tail
</Formula>

<WithTailChoice opts={opts} ba={false} />

### Examples

#### If A were B

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "که زه ستا پر ځای **وای**",
      f: "ku zu staa pur dzaay **waay**",
      e: "If I **were** in your place",
    },
    {
      p: "که مونږ خبر **وای**، نه راتلو.",
      f: "ku moonG khabúr **waay**, nú raatloo.",
      e: "If had known, we wouldn't have come.",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### You wish A were B

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "**کاشکې ته دلته **وای!",
      f: "kaashke tu dălta **waay**!",
      e: "If only you were here!",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### A should have been B

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "د باید دلته **وای**!",
      f: "tu baayad dălta **waay**!",
      e: "You should have been here!",
    },
    {
      p: "د باید دلته **وای**",
      f: "tu baayad dălta **waay**",
      e: "You had to be here",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

## "Would have been" Equative

This is used to talk about:

- If some hypothetical condition were true, A would have been B
- A should have been B, or it would have been good if A would have been B
