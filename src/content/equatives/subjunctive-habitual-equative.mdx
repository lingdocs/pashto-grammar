In the last section we looked at the present equative, which we use to say something *is* something currently. But **we can only use the present equative for something is something *right now, at this moment***. What if we want to say that something *generally is something* or if we *hope something is something*? For that **we need to use a different form**.

## Subjunctive / Habitual Equative Form

<EquativeFormChoice 
    forms={{
        sentence: {
            displayForm: addToForm(
                [grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain, " ", { p: "...", f: "..." }, " "],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive,
            ),
            english: [
                ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
                ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
                ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
                ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
                ["He/she/it is ...", "They are ..."],
                ["He/she/it is ...", "They are ..."],
            ],
        },
        pure: {
            displayForm: grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive,
        },
    }}
    opts={opts}
/>

This form is used with two different meanings:

1. **Subjunctive** - to talk about something being something when the statement involves a hypothetical condition, a wish, desire, hope, or statement of whether it should or shouldn't be, as in:

    <Examples opts={opts}>{[
        { p: "امید لرم چې خوشحاله وي", f: "Umeed larum che khosháala wee", e: "I hope he's happy" },
    ]}</Examples>

2. **Habitual** - to say that something is generally or repeatedly something, as in:

    <Examples opts={opts}>{[
        { p: "سحار کې چمن لوند وي", f: "saháar ke chaman loond wee", e: "The grass is wet in the morning. (generally, habitually)" },
    ]}</Examples>

### With a Subjunctive Meaning

#### Judgement/obligation

The subjunctive form can be used to talk about it being being good or bad, necessary, or required that something is something.

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "ښه ده چې دلته یې", f: "xa da che dălta ye.", e: "It's good that you're here." },
    { p: "هغوي باید په ښوونځي کې وي", f: "hagwee baayad pu xowundzee ke wee.", e: "They have to be in school." },
]}</Examples>

#### Desire

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "امید لرم چې هلته وي", f: "Umeed larum che halta wee.", e: "I hope they're there." },
    { p: "هغه غواړي چې مونږ په کور کې یو", f: "haghá ghwaaRee che moonG pu kor ke yoo.", e: "He wants us to be home." },
]}</Examples>

#### Conditions

The subjunctive form is also used to talk about conditions or possibilities. *If A = B, then...* or *It could be that A = B ...*

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "که دوکان کې وریژې وي نو وایې خله", f: "ku dokaan ke wrejze wee, no waa-ye-khla", e: "If there's rice in the store, buy it" },
    { p: "کېدی شي چې ډوډۍ تیاره وي", f: "kedey shee che DoDúy tayaara wee", e: "The food could be ready" },
]}</Examples>

### With a Habitual Meaning

This same form is used when you are saying that **A = B generally, habitually, or repeatedly**. For example:

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "هغه تر ماښامه پورې په دوکان کې وي", f: "haghá tur maaxaama pore pu dookáan ke wee", e: "He's in the shop until evening. (generally, habitually)" },
    { p: "اتو بجو نه بعد دوکان بند وي", f: "atu bajo na bad dookáan band wee", e: "The shop is closed after 8 o'clock. (generally, habitually)" },
]}</Examples>

⚠ **Warning**: For English speakers **it take some time to get used to choosing between the *present* and *habitual* equatives**. Standard English uses the same form for both, but in Pashto the forms change!

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "ماښام دوکان بند وي.", f: "maaxáam dookáan band wee", e: "The shop is closed in the evening. (generally, every day - habitual form)" },
    { p: "دوکان دند دی.", f: "dookáan band dey.", e: "The shop is closed. (right now, at this moment - present form)" },
]}</Examples>

In English, we just say "is" in both situations. But **in Pashto, you have to pick between the two forms**. Use the present form for things that are something in the moment, and use the habitual form for things are generally or habitually something.

Interestingly, there is also a separate [habitual equative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_be) or "habitual be" in Southern or African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Take this pun for example:
