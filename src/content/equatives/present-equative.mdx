## Present Equative Form

Here are the **present equative endings** that you have to use depending on the subject. We use this **present equative** form when:

- A = B right now/currently
- A = B definately or categorically

Not that this is **only for making statements about what is currently or 100% true**. If something tends to be true, or is habitually true, then you will need to use the <Link to="/equatives/habitual-equative">habitual equative</Link>.

<EquativeFormChoice
  forms={{
    sentence: {
      displayForm: addToForm(
        [grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain, " ", { p: "...", f: "..." }, " "],
        grammarUnits.equativeEndings.present
      ),
      english: [
        ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
        ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
        ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
        ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
        ["He/it is ...", "They are ..."],
        ["She/it is ...", "They are ..."],
      ],
    },
    pure: {
      displayForm: grammarUnits.equativeEndings.present,
    },
  }}
  opts={defaultTextOptions}
/>

**Note**: in colloquial speech with some dialects, people will use <InlinePs opts={defaultTextOptions} ps={{ p: "ده", f: "da" }} /> for both masculine and feminine subjects.

Flip through the following examples and notice how the equative changes depending on the subject.

  items={[
    {
      title: "1st pers. sing.",
      ex: { p: "زه خوشحاله یم", f: "zu khosháala yum", e: "I am happy" },

      },

  })}

## Examples

<Examples
  opts={defaultTextOptions}
  ex={[
    {
      p: "هغوي ماشومان دي",
      f: "haghwée mashoomáan dee",
      e: "They are children",
    },
    { p: "ته ډاکټر یې؟", f: "tu DakTár ye?", e: "Are you a doctor?" },
    {
      p: "تاسو ډاکټران یئ؟",
      f: "taaso DakTaráan yey?",
      e: "Are you (pl.) doctors?",
    },
    { p: "دا ستا کور دی", f: "daa staa kor day", e: "That's your house" },
    {
      p: "دا ستا کورونه دي",
      f: "daa staa koróona dee",
      e: "Those are your houses",
    },
  ]}
/>

Notice how the equative agrees with the subject, but also how the complement can inflect (change) depending on the gender and number. We'll understand more about how this works when we look at _inflection_.

<Examples
  opts={defaultTextOptions}
  ex={[
    { p: "زه ستړی یم", f: "zu stúRay yum", e: "I (m.) am tired 👨" },
    { p: "زه ستړې یم", f: "zu stúRe yum", e: "I (f.) am tired 👩" },
    { p: "ته پښتون یې؟", f: "tu puxtoon ye?", e: "Are you (m.) a Pashtun?" },
    { p: "ته پښتنه یې؟", f: "tu puxtana ye?", e: "Are you (f.) a Pashtun?" },
    {
      p: "تاسو پښتانه یې؟",
      f: "taaso puxtaanu yey?",
      e: "Are you (m. pl.) Pashtuns?",
    },
    {
      p: "تاسو پښتنې یې؟",
      f: "taaso puxtane yey?",
      e: "Are you (f. pl.) Pashtuns?",
    },
  ]}
/>

Note: To understand why/how these words are changing, you will need to read up on _inflection_.

## Notes on word order

When you're asking a question, all you have to do is change the intonation. You don't have to change the word order like you do in English.

<Examples
  opts={defaultTextOptions}
  ex={[
    { p: "ته پښتون یې.", f: "tu puxtoon ye.", e: "You (m.) are a Pashtun." },
    { p: "ته پښتون یې؟", f: "tu puxtoon ye?", e: "Are you (m.) a Pashtun?" },
  ]}
/>

**99.9% of the time the equative will go at the end of the sentence.** But in poetry the order often gets flipped around. You can also flip the order around to make an emphatic point.

<Examples
  opts={defaultTextOptions}
  ex={[
    { p: "خو ته یې افعان", f: "kho tu ye afgháan", e: "But you are Afghan!" },
  ]}
/>
