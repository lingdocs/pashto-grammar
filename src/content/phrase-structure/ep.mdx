**There is no "to be" verb in Pashto**. 🤯 Let that sink in for a second. There's no infinitive "to be" form. You can't say "It's good *to be* here."  We can't use "to be" as a verb and make normal verb phrases like we do in other languages.

In Pashto, we use a special structure called an **equative phrase (EP)** when we talk about something being something.

Basically with an equative phrase we have three main parts:

- **"A"** a subject (the thing we are talking about)
- **"B"** a predicate (what the thing *is*)
- **"="** an equative at the end to join them together

Notice how the word order is different than it is in English.

<EquativeIllustration />

There are two ways to build an equative phrase:

1. <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + <Link to="/phrase-structure/ep/#whats-an-ep-complement">Complement</Link> + Equative
2. <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + Equative 

The equative will **always agree with the last NP** in the phrase. So for #1 it will agree with the *subject* and for #2 it will agree with the *predicate*.

## 1. NP + Complement

<BasicBlocks large blocks={[
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "A", top: "Subject" },
    { bottom: "Comp.", inside: "B", top: "Predicate" },
    { bottom: "Equative", inside: "=" },
]} />

This is the most common phrase you will see for describing what a subject is. With this kind of phrase we use an <Link to="/phrase-structure/ep/#whats-an-ep-complement">EP complement</Link> to describe the subject <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link>.

### What's an EP Complement?

An **EP complement** is one of four things:

- <Link to="#with-an-adjective">adjective</Link>
- <Link to="#with-a-location-adverb">location adverb</Link>
- <Link to="#with-a-sandwich">sandwich</Link>
- <Link to="#with-a-complement-noun">complement noun</Link>

Let's look at some examples using each of these kinds of complements. Click on the <i className="fas fa-cubes" /> to see how the phrase in divided into blocks and click on the <EditIcon /> to change things and play around with the phrase.

#### With an adjective

An adjective is a word that describes what the subject is like. Notice that if possible, it will inflect to agree with the subject.

}</EditableEPEx>

#### With a location adverb

A location adverb is a word that describes the location of the subject. Don't worry, it doesn't inflect.

<EditableEPEx opts={opts} hideOmitSubject>{
    {"blocks":[{"key":0.0539623363055568,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":10,"distance":"far"}}}}],"predicate":{"type":"Complement","Complement":{"type":"EQComp","selection":{"type":"loc. adv.","entry":{"ts":1527812558,"i":6251,"p":"دلته","f":"dălta","g":"dalta","e":"here","c":"loc. adv."}}}},"equative":{"tense":"present","negative":false},"omitSubject":false}
}</EditableEPEx>

<EditableEPEx opts={opts} hideOmitSubject>{
    {"blocks":[{"key":0.0539623363055568,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":5,"distance":"far"}}}}],"predicate":{"type":"Complement","Complement":{"type":"EQComp","selection":{"type":"loc. adv.","entry":{"ts":1527812449,"i":13954,"p":"هلته","f":"hálta, álta","g":"halta,alta","e":"there","c":"loc. adv."}}}},"equative":{"tense":"present","negative":false},"omitSubject":false}
}</EditableEPEx>

#### With a sandwich

You can also use any kind of sandwich to describe the subject of an EP.

<EditableEPEx opts={opts} hideOmitSubject>{
    {"blocks":[{"key":0.0539623363055568,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":1,"distance":"far"}}}}],"predicate":{"type":"Complement","Complement":{"type":"EQComp","selection":{"type":"sandwich","before":{"p":"له","f":"la"},"after":{"p":"سره","f":"sara"},"e":"with","inside":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":3,"distance":"far"}}}}},"equative":{"tense":"present","negative":false},"omitSubject":false}

}</EditableEPEx>

#### With a complement noun

In Pashto there are a lot of [compound verbs](https://www.lingdocs.com/blog/pashto-compound-verbs) that use *nouns* as the complement. For example, to become angry <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "غوسه کېدل", f: "ghwUsa kedul", e: "to become angry" }} /> uses the complement <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "غوسه", f: "ghWusa", e: "anger" }} />. This complement noun can also be used with an equative, for instance.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    { p: "هغه **غوسه** دی", f: "hagha **ghwUsa** dey", e: "He is **angry**" },
])}</Examples>

In English it would [sound funny](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U7X7cEh5au8) to say "I am anger," but in Pashto it's normal. These complement nouns get treated almost as if they were adjectives. Except...

You will notice how when people use these complement nouns with equatives they *don't inflect* based on the subject. For instance you could ask if someone is resting using the word <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "استرحات", f: "istiraháat", e: "rest" }} /> from the compound verb <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "استرحات کول", f: "istirahaat kawul", e: "to rest" }} />.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    { p: "ته استرحات یې؟", f: "tu istirahaat ye?", e: "Are you (m.) **resting**?" },
    { p: "ته استرحات یې؟", f: "tu istirahaat ye?", e: "Are you (f.) **resting**?" },
])}</Examples>

You don't inflect the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "استرحات", f: "istiraháat", e: "rest" }} /> because it's a noun, not an adjective.

It's not always that straightforward though. Some complement nouns get used so much they get treated (by some people) as adjectives and *will* inflect. A good example of this is the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "خبر", f: "khabur", e: "news" }} /> in <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "خبرېدل", f: "khabredul", e: "to become aware of" }} />. Some people will inflect it, and some people won't.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    { p: "زه **خبر** یم", f: "zu **khabúr** yum", e: "I (f.) am aware", sub: "not inflected" },
    { p: "زه **خبره** یم", f: "zu **khabúra** yum", e: "I (f.) am aware", sub: "inflected" },
])}</Examples>

## 2. NP + NP

<BasicBlocks large blocks={[
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "A", top: "Subject" },
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "B", top: "Predicate" },
    { bottom: "Equative", inside: "=" },
]} />

Sometimes you need to say that an <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> is an <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link>. <strong>The equative always agrees with the <em>last</em> <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link></strong>.

## Adding APs

You can add as many <Link to="/phrase-structure/ap/">APs</Link> as you like to a phrase. For example if we wanted to say that the weather is good <strong>here</strong> we can add the <Link to="/phrase-structure/ap/">AP</Link> <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "دلته", f: "dălta", e: "here - adverb" }} />.

<EditableEPEx opts={opts} hideOmitSubject>{
    {"blocks":[{"key":0.925654634890972,"block":{"type":"AP","selection":{"type":"adverb","entry":{"ts":1527812558,"i":6251,"p":"دلته","f":"dălta","g":"dalta","e":"here","c":"loc. adv."}}}},{"key":0.0539623363055568,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"noun","entry":{"ts":1527812672,"i":14045,"p":"هوا","f":"hawaa","g":"hawaa","e":"air, atmosphere; weather","c":"n. f."},"gender":"fem","genderCanChange":false,"number":"singular","numberCanChange":true,"adjectives":[]}}}}],"predicate":{"type":"Complement","NP":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"noun","entry":{"ts":1527812817,"i":10010,"p":"کتاب","f":"kitáab","g":"kitaab","e":"book","c":"n. m."},"gender":"masc","genderCanChange":false,"number":"plural","numberCanChange":true,"adjectives":[]}},"Complement":{"type":"EQComp","selection":{"type":"adjective","entry":{"ts":1527812796,"i":8655,"p":"ښه","f":"xu","g":"xu","e":"good","c":"adj."}}}},"equative":{"tense":"present","negative":false},"omitSubject":false}
}</EditableEPEx>

## Leaving out the subject

If it's obvious who/what you're talking about you can always leave out the subject.
