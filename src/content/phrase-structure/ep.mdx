**There is no "to be" verb in Pashto**. ðŸ¤¯ Let that sink in for a second. There's no infinitive "to be" form. You can't say "It's good *to be* here."  We can't use "to be" as a verb and make normal verb phrases like we do in other language.

In Pashto, we use a special structure called an **equative phrase (EP)** when we talk about something being something.

Basically with an equative phrase we have three main parts:

- **"A"** a subject (the thing we are talking about)
- **"B"** a predicate (what the thing *is*)
- **"="** an equative at the end to join them together

Notice how the word order is different than it is in English.

There are two ways to build an equative phrase:

1. <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + <Link to="/phrase-structure/ep/#whats-an-ep-complement">Complement</Link> + Equative
    
    <BasicBlocks large blocks={[
        { bottom: "NP", inside: "A", top: "Subject" },
        { bottom: "Comp.", inside: "B", top: "Predicate" },
        { bottom: "Equative", inside: "=" },
    ]} />
 
2. <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + Equative 

    <BasicBlocks large blocks={[
        { bottom: "NP", inside: "A", top: "Subject" },
        { bottom: "NP", inside: "B", top: "Predicate" },
        { bottom: "Equative", inside: "=" },
    ]} />

The equative will **always agree with the last NP** in the phrase. So for #1 it will agree with the *subject* and for #2 it will agree with the *predicate*.

## 1. NP + Complement

<BasicBlocks large blocks={[
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "A", top: "Subject" },
    { bottom: "Comp.", inside: "B", top: "Predicate" },
    { bottom: "Equative", inside: "=" },
]} />

This is the most common phrase you will see for describing what a subject is. With this kind of phrase we use an <Link to="/phrase-structure/ep/#whats-an-ep-complement">EP complement</Link> to describe the subject <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link>.

### What's an EP Complement?

An **EP complement** is one of four things:

- adjective
- location adverb
- sandwich
- complement noun

Let's look at some examples using each of these kinds of complements.

#### With an adjective

An adjective is a word that describes what the subject is like. Notice that it will inflect to agree with the subject.

EXAMPLES COMING...

#### With a location adverb

An adverb is a word that describes the location of the subject. Don't worry, it doesn't inflect.

EXAMPLES COMING...

#### With a sandwich

#### With a complement noun

## 2. NP + NP

<BasicBlocks large blocks={[
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "A", top: "Subject" },
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "B", top: "Predicate" },
    { bottom: "Equative", inside: "=" },
]} />
