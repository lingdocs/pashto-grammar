**There is no "to be" verb in Pashto**. ü§Ø Let that sink in for a second. There's no infinitive "to be" form. You can't say "It's good *to be* here."  We can't use "to be" as a verb and make normal verb phrases like we do in other languages.

In Pashto, we use a special structure called an **equative phrase (EP)** when we talk about something being something.

Basically with an equative phrase we have three main parts:

- **"A"** a subject (the thing we are talking about)
- **"B"** a predicate (what the thing *is*)
- **"="** an equative at the end to join them together

Notice how the word order is different than it is in English.

There are two ways to build an equative phrase:

1. <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + <Link to="/phrase-structure/ep/#whats-an-ep-complement">Complement</Link> + Equative
2. <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link> + Equative 

The equative will **always agree with the last NP** in the phrase. So for #1 it will agree with the *subject* and for #2 it will agree with the *predicate*.

## 1. NP + Complement

<BasicBlocks large blocks={[
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "A", top: "Subject" },
    { bottom: "Comp.", inside: "B", top: "Predicate" },
    { bottom: "Equative", inside: "=" },
]} />

This is the most common phrase you will see for describing what a subject is. With this kind of phrase we use an <Link to="/phrase-structure/ep/#whats-an-ep-complement">EP complement</Link> to describe the subject <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NP</Link>.

### What's an EP Complement?

An **EP complement** is one of four things:

- adjective
- location adverb
- sandwich
- complement noun

Let's look at some examples using each of these kinds of complements.

#### With an adjective

An adjective is a word that describes what the subject is like. Notice that if possible, it will inflect to agree with the subject.

}</EditableEPEx>

#### With a location adverb

A location adverb is a word that describes the location of the subject. Don't worry, it doesn't inflect.

<EditableEPEx opts={opts}>{
    {"blocks":[{"key":0.0539623363055568,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":10,"distance":"far"}}}}],"predicate":{"type":"Complement","Complement":{"type":"EQComp","selection":{"type":"loc. adv.","entry":{"ts":1527812558,"i":6251,"p":"ÿØŸÑÿ™Ÿá","f":"dƒÉlta","g":"dalta","e":"here","c":"loc. adv."}}}},"equative":{"tense":"present","negative":false},"omitSubject":false}
}</EditableEPEx>

<EditableEPEx opts={opts}>{
    {"blocks":[{"key":0.0539623363055568,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":5,"distance":"far"}}}}],"predicate":{"type":"Complement","Complement":{"type":"EQComp","selection":{"type":"loc. adv.","entry":{"ts":1527812449,"i":13954,"p":"ŸáŸÑÿ™Ÿá","f":"h√°lta, √°lta","g":"halta,alta","e":"there","c":"loc. adv."}}}},"equative":{"tense":"present","negative":false},"omitSubject":false}
}</EditableEPEx>

#### With a sandwich

<EditableEPEx opts={opts}>{
    {"blocks":[{"key":0.0539623363055568,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":1,"distance":"far"}}}}],"predicate":{"type":"Complement","Complement":{"type":"EQComp","selection":{"type":"sandwich","before":{"p":"ŸÑŸá","f":"la"},"after":{"p":"ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿá","f":"sara"},"e":"with","inside":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":3,"distance":"far"}}}}},"equative":{"tense":"present","negative":false},"omitSubject":false}
}</EditableEPEx>

<EditableEPEx opts={opts}>{
    {"blocks":[{"key":0.0539623363055568,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":4,"distance":"far"}}}}],"predicate":{"type":"Complement","Complement":{"type":"EQComp","selection":{"type":"sandwich","before":{"p":"ŸæŸá","f":"pu"},"after":{"p":"⁄©€ê","f":"ke"},"e":"in","inside":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"noun","entry":{"ts":1527812828,"i":10540,"p":"⁄©Ÿàÿ±","f":"kor","g":"kor","e":"house, home","c":"n. m."},"gender":"masc","genderCanChange":false,"number":"singular","numberCanChange":true,"adjectives":[]}}}}},"equative":{"tense":"present","negative":false},"omitSubject":false}
}</EditableEPEx>


#### With a complement noun

## 2. NP + NP

<BasicBlocks large blocks={[
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "A", top: "Subject" },
    { bottom: "NP", inside: "B", top: "Predicate" },
    { bottom: "Equative", inside: "=" },
]} />
