Another building block we have in Pashto phrases in the **AP (Adverb Phrase)**. Adverb Phrases are used to give more information about the phrase in terms of time, manner, place, degree, etc.

An AP is either:

- an adverb, or
- a sandwich

### Adverb

An adverb is a word or expression that modifies the time, manner, place, etc. of a phrase.
