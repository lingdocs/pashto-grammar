title: The Kids' Section üë¶

import {
    defaultTextOptions as opts,
    InlinePs,
    Examples,
} from "@lingdocs/pashto-inflector";
import psmd from "../../lib/psmd";
import Link from "../../components/Link";

Pashto phrases are built with **blocks** that are <Link to="/phrase-structure/np/">NPs</Link>, <Link to="/phrase-structure/ap/">APs</Link>, or complements, with a verb or equative at the end. Here are some examples of what the phrases can look like.

<BasicBlocks blocks={["NP", "Comp.", "Equative"]} />
<BasicBlocks blocks={["AP", "NP", "NP", "Equative"]} />
<BasicBlocks blocks={["NP", "Comp.", "Equative"]} />
<BasicBlocks blocks={["Verb"]} />
<BasicBlocks blocks={["NP", "NP", "Equative"]} />

**After the first block** in a phrase comes a special place that we'll call the **kids' section**.

<BasicBlocks showKidsSection blocks={["NP", "Comp.", "Equative"]} />
<BasicBlocks showKidsSection blocks={["AP", "NP", "NP", "Equative"]} />
<BasicBlocks showKidsSection blocks={["NP", "Comp.", "Equative"]} />
<BasicBlocks showKidsSection blocks={["Verb"]} />
<BasicBlocks showKidsSection blocks={["NP", "NP", "Equative"]} />

In Pashto we have a bunch of little words that we will treat like little **children**.

<ul>
    <li>The emphatic <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÿÆŸà", f: "kho" }} /> particle</li> 
    <li>The <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÿ®Ÿá", f: "ba" }} /> particle</li>
    <li><Link to="/pronouns/pronouns-mini/">Mini-pronouns</Link>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ŸÖ€ê", f: "me", e: "1st pers sing" }} /></li> 
        <li><InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÿØ€ê", f: "de", e: "2nd pers sing" }} /></li>  
        <li><InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ŸÖŸà", f: "mU", e: "1st/2nd pers plur" }} /></li> 
        <li><InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "€å€ê", f: "ye", e: "3rd pers" }} /></li>
    </ul>
    <li>The jussive <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÿØ€ê", f: "de", e: "may" }} /></li>
</ul>

These little words/particles can't run around anywhere in the sentence. **They have to stay in the kids' section**. They're not allowed to go anywhere else! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Also like well behaved children, these little words have to line up in the right order. There are a few rules for the *inside the kids' seciton*.
 - They need to follow the order of the list above
 - The <Link to="/pronouns/pronouns-mini/">mini-pronouns</Link> need to line up in order of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person
 - You can't have duplicate mini-pronouns like <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "€å€ê €å€ê", f: "ye ye" }} />
