Although Pashto is written using the Arabic script, it is often written with latin-based phonetics in dictionaries or other places to show more information about how to pronounce the vowels of the word, or to show where the emphasis of the word is placed.

## LingDocs Pashto Phonetics

There have been many of different systems or conventions for writing Pashto in phonetics script. Below is a system used in this grammar and with the <Link to="https://dictionary.lingdocs.com">LingDocs Pashto Dictionary</Link>.

### Example Text

##### In Pashto

<p dir="rtl">{exText.p}</p>

##### In LingDocs Pashto Phonetics

<p>{exText.f}</p>

##### In IPA

<p>
  {translatePhonetics(exText.f, {
    system: "ipa",
    dialect: "standard",
  })}
</p>

A couple of things to note about this system:

- There are **no special symbols** required so you can type it with a regular keyboard.
- The spelling is **case-sensitive**. Retroflex consonants (D, T, R, N) and one other vowel (U) are always written with capital letters - ie. D (ډ) is different than d (د).

### Accent / emphasis

In order to show which syllable the emphasis falls on in a word, an accent (´) is added above the vowel with the emphasis.

**Exámple in Énglish**: I'm véry consciéntious and I álways put the émphasis on the corréct sýllable.

### Seperating sounds with `

If two sounds need to go right next to each other without blending a backtick (\`) is used to keep them apart. For example, **fas\`ha** is pronounced "fas-ha", not "fasha".
