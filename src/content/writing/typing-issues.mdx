## Finding a good keyboard 📱

Typing proper Pashto on a phone can be difficult, and so many people make do with Urdu or Farsi keyboards. The following two keyboards are reccommended for good Pashto support:

- For **Android**: [GBoard - the Google Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&hl=en&gl=US)
- For **iOS**: the native iOS keyboard

## The ـیـ in the middle of words

When you write a ی or a ي, they both appear as a ـیـ in the middle of words. So when you see a ـیـ it can be either:

- a "ay" sound
- a "ee" sound
- a "y" sound

This can lead to confusion when typing or searching for things online. For example when typing the word <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "مینه", f: "meena" }} /> should you use a ی or a ي in the middle of the word? 🤷‍♂️ Does it matter? Both look exactly the same, but when you type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> and try to search for it, it makes a big difference! Try it on these words:

- مینه (spelled with ی)
- مينه (spelled with ي)

It seems best to always **use ی when typing in the middle of words**, to avoid confusion. This seems to be the most common practice, but it's not always the case. If you use [qamosona.com](https://qamosona.com/), for example, you will find that the middle of words are often spelled with a ي and so you will need to keep that in mind and use ي in the middle when searching.

## ی vs. ى

Depending on the keyboard used, you might get one of two basically identical looking versions of ی. This can cause massive confusion when you search for words. 😖

- ی Farsi Yeh ([unicode 06CC](https://unicode-table.com/en/06CC/)) 👍 ✔
- ى Alef Maksura ([unicode 0649](https://unicode-table.com/en/0649/)) 👎 ❌

Make sure you don't have a bad keyboard ⌨🙅‍♂️ that uses the Alef Maksura ى! To check, you can go to [this site](https://unicode-table.com/en/) and type a ی to see which one you're using.
