The first verb form we'll learn is the **present**. This will be the first tool in our toolbox of verb forms. 🧰 With each verb form we'll learn two things:

1. 🧪 How to make it  
2. 🔨 When to use it

## How to make it

As with all verb forms, the **present form** is made by following a very simple formula which is the same for every single verb.

<Formula>
    Imperfective Stem + <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/">Present Ending</Link>
</Formula>

The <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/">present ending</Link> will change according to what the subject is. Have a look through the verbs below and see how the present form follows the same formula for all of them. 👇

<BasicVerbShowCase opts={opts} tense="presentVerb" />

**Notes:**

- To make the verb negative, you just add a <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "نه", f: "nú" }} /> in front of the verb.
- To make the verb into a question, you just have to change the tone of voice. The word order doesn't change.

## When to use it

You use this form to talk about something that:

- happens generally
- is currently happening
- or is definitely about to happen

So if we think of a graph of reality like this,

<div className="text-center">
    <img src={realityGraph} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

The **present form** would look something like this: 

<div className="text-center">
    <img src={presentTime} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

Here are some examples of how the present form is used in different situations:

### Happens generally

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "مونږ هره ورځ چای **سکو**.",
        f: "moonG hăra wradz chaay **skoo**.",
        e: "We **drink** tea every day.",
    },
    {
        p: "زما پلار پتلون **اغوندي**.",
        f: "zmaa plaar patloon **aghondee**.",
        e: "My dad **wears** pants."
    },
    {
        p: "زه په عربي **نه پوهېږم**.",
        f: "zu pu arabee **nú poheGum**.",
        e: "I **don't understand** Arabic.",
    },
    {
        p: "ته له مرګه **وېرېږې**؟",
        f: "tu la marga **weréGe**?",
        e: "**Are** you **afraid** of death?"
    },
])}</Examples>

### Is currently happening

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "نن شپه ستوري **ځلېږي**.",
        f: "nun shpa storee **dzaléGee**.",
        e: "The stars **are shining** tonight.",
    },
    {
        p: "زه بازار ته **ځم**.",
        f: "zu baazaar ta **dzum**.",
        e: "I'm **going** to the bazaar."
    },
    {
        p: "هغوي اوس ډوډۍ **خوري**",
        f: "haghwee oos DoDuy **khoree**.",
        e: "They are **eating** food now.",
    },
    {
        p: "ته څه **کوې**؟",
        f: "tu tsu **kawe**?",
        e: "What **are** you **doing**?"
    },
])}</Examples>

### Is definately about to happen

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "**هغه نن **راځي.",
        f: "haghá nun **raadzée**.",
        e: "**He's coming** today.",
    },
])}</Examples>
