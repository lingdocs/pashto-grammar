All verbs have **a set of two roots and two stems**, and these roots and stems are the building blocks that we use to make all the different verb forms.

## Introducing the Verb Tree

<div style={{ maxWidth: "350px", margin: "0 auto" }}>
    <img src={verbTreeBase} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

You can think of the roots and stems as a tree that exists for every verb form. There are two stems (like branches) on the top, and two roots on the bottom. The root on the bottom left is the *dictionary form* or the *infinitive* of the verb, which is how you'd find it in a dictionary.

These four items are the basic building blocks for making different verb forms. Whenever we make a verb form, we just have to take the right root or stem, and attach some endings to it. This means **Pashto verbs are extremely simple, regular, and predictable**, really! üëç

The tree is divided from top to bottom. On the top are the *stems*, which are used for present and future tense verb forms, and on the bottom are the *roots* which are used for past tense verb forms.

<div className="mb-4" style={{ maxWidth: "500px", margin: "0 auto" }}>
    <img src={verbTreePastPresent} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

The tree is also divided from left to right. On the left we have the [*imperfective* aspect](/verbs/verb-aspect/#i-classnamefas-fa-video--imperfective-aspect), and on the right we have the [*perfective* aspect](/verbs/verb-aspect/#i-classnamefas-fa-camera--perfective-aspect). Remember, the [aspect](/verbs/verb-aspect/) is like the perspective we take in looking at the action. 

<div className="mb-4" style={{ maxWidth: "400px", margin: "0 auto" }}>
    <img src={verbTreeImperfectivePerfective} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

On the <i className="fas fa-camera" /> **perfective** side of the tree:

 - The accent/emphasis **always** goes on the first syllable
 - The verb has a <PerfectiveHead /> that splits off into a seperate <BlockTerm />

## Making the Verb Tree

Many verbs follow a very clear pattern of how the roots and stems grow out from the dictionary form. But there are some verbs that have irregular roots and stems. If you're new to verbs, don't worry about reading or understanding everything all the way to the bottom.

### Regular Verbs

With regular verbs, knowing all the roots and stems is simple:

- The perfective root is made by:
    - **adding the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={grammarUnits.ooPrefix} /> prefix** as the <PerfectiveHead />
    - **shifting the accent to the front**
- The stems are just the **shorter version** of the roots

Flip through all these regular verbs and notice the pattern of how they're all built.

export const regularVerbs = verbs.filter((verb) => (
    !verb.entry.psp && !verb.entry.ssp && !verb.entry.prp && !verb.entry.pprtp && !verb.entry.noOo && !verb.entry.sepOo
));

export const regularTrans = regularVerbs.filter((verb) => verb.entry.c && verb.entry.c.includes("v. trans."));

<InfoCarousel items={regularTrans} hidePastParticiple />

### Introducing the Perfective Head

On the right (perfective) side of the verb tree beside the <i className="fas fa-camera" /> icon you'll notice there's a button labelled "split head." When you click it you'll see how one part splits off the rest of the verb stem/root. The front part that splits off is what we'll call the **perfective head**. In the phrase structure, it gets treated like a seperate <BlockTerm /> from the rest of the verb. For regular verbs starting with a consonant the perfective head is just the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "Ÿà", f: "oo" }} /> prefix. But for verbs starting with an <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÿß", f: "aa", e: "" }} /> or <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÿß", f: "a", e: "" }} /> the perfective side starts with a <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "Ÿà", f: "w" }} /> in front and then the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÿß", f: "aa", e: "" }} /> is taken with it in the split so the perfective head is <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "Ÿàÿß", f: "waa", e: "" }} />. Look for verbs starting with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÿß", f: "aa", e: "" }} /> in the examples above and see how this works.

### Regular Intransitive Verbs

Regular intransitive verb work the same except that:

- the stems change the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ŸÄ€êÿØ", f: "-ed" }} /> in the roots to a <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ŸÄ€ê⁄ñ", f: "-eG" }} />
- Some of these verbs can also leave the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ŸÄ€ê⁄ñ", f: "-eG" }} /> out completely for a short version

export const regularIntrans = regularVerbs.filter((verb) => verb.entry.c && verb.entry.c.includes("v. intrans."));

<InfoCarousel items={regularIntrans} hidePastParticiple />

### Verbs with irregular stems

There are many verbs where the top half (the stems/present form) is totally different from the bottom half (the roots/past form).

export const irregularPresentFormVerbs = verbs.filter((verb) => (
    verb.entry.psp && !verb.entry.ssp && !verb.entry.prp && !verb.entry.pprtp && !verb.entry.noOo && !verb.entry.sepO
));

<InfoCarousel items={irregularPresentFormVerbs} highlighted={["imperfective stem", "perfective stem"]} hidePastParticiple />

### Verbs with no <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "Ÿà", f: "√≥o" }} /> prefix

Some verbs don't take an <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={grammarUnits.ooPrefix} /> prefix. Instead, on the perfective side they just shift the accent up to the first syllable. The first syllable also splits off the front, just like the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "Ÿà", f: "√≥o" }} /> would.

It's super important to remember that even though we can't add a <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={grammarUnits.ooPrefix} /> prefix, we still have to shift the accent to the front of the root/stem in the perfective aspect.

Notice how the only difference between the imperfective and perfective aspects is where the emphasis falls. The accent totally changes the meaning of the verb form! ü§Ø

export const separableVerbs = verbs.filter((verb) => (
    verb.entry.separationAtP && [
        "Ÿæÿ±€ê",
        "⁄©€ê",
        "ÿ®Ÿà",
        "⁄ÖŸÖ",
        "ÿ±ÿß",
    ].some(x => verb.entry.p.startsWith(x)) &&
    !verb.entry.ssp
));

The other fascinating part about these types of verbs is that the first syllable gets split off as the <Link to="/verbs/roots-and-stems/#introducing-the-perfective-head">perfective head</Link>.

<InfoCarousel items={separableVerbs} hidePastParticiple />

### Totally Irregular Verbs

There are a few more verbs which are even more irregular, and these just have to be memorized. Here are some of them.

export const irregularVerbs = verbs.filter((verb) => {
    let score = 0;
    if (verb.entry.psp) score = score + 1;
    if (verb.entry.ssp) score = score + 1;
    if (verb.entry.prp) score = score + 1;
    if (verb.entry.pprtp) score = score + 1;
    return score > 1 && !verb.entry.l;
});

<InfoCarousel items={irregularVerbs} hidePastParticiple highlighted={["imperfective stem", "perfective stem", "perfective root"]} />

## The past participle

There's one more element we need to add to the verb tree: **the past participle**. The past particple is used for making perfect verb forms, adjectival verbs etc. We put this at the bottom in the middle because **it doesn't fit into either aspect** and is seperate from the perfective/imperfective divide.

In almost all verbs, the past participle is just the imperfective root plus a <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "€å", f: "ey" }} /> tail that inflects. The <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "⁄©ŸàŸÑ", f: "kawul" }} /> and <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "⁄©€êÿØŸÑ", f: "kedul" }} /> verbs are the only ones that have irregular past participles.

## With the negative

The negative <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ŸÜŸá", f: "n√∫" , e: "not" }} /> is a <BlockTerm /> used to make verbs negative, and <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ŸÖŸá", f: "m√∫", e: "don't" }} /> is used to with the imperative forms.

### The negative takes over the accent

When one of these negatives is used **it always takes over the accent from the verb**.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    { p: "ÿØÿ™ŸÑŸá **⁄©€êŸÜŸá**", f: "dƒÉlta **k√©na**", e: "sit here" },
    { p: "ÿØŸÑÿ™Ÿá **ŸÖŸá ⁄©€êŸÜŸá**", f: "dƒÉlta **m√∫ kena**", e: "don't sit here" },
    { p: "ÿ≤Ÿá Ÿàÿ±ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿá **ÿ∫⁄ñ€êÿØŸÖ**", f: "zu wƒÉr-sara **ghuGed√∫m**", e: "I was talking with him" },
    { p: "ÿ≤Ÿá Ÿàÿ±ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿá **ŸÜŸá ÿ∫⁄ñ€êÿØŸÖ**", f: "zu wƒÉr-sara **n√∫ ghuGedum**", e: "I was talking with him" },
])}</Examples>
