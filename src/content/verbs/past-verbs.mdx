Past tense verbs in Pashto are famous for being very difficult and confusing for the learner. Thankfully there are some very simple rules that we can learn, and with a little practice (ok, a *lot* of practice) you'll find there's nothing scary about the past tense in Pashto at all.

Now that we're making past tense verbs, we will be using the **bottom half** of the <Link to="/verbs/roots-and-stems/">roots and stems</Link> tree.

<div style={{ maxWidth: "350px", margin: "0 auto 2rem auto" }}>
    <img src={verbTreePastPresent} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

And when we use these roots we will have to choose between the <i className="fas fa-video" /> imperfective and <i className="fas fa-camera" /> perfective aspects on the left and right sides.

<div style={{ maxWidth: "350px", margin: "0 auto 2rem auto" }}>
    <img src={verbTreeImperfectivePerfective} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

We'll use the **imperfective and perfective roots** to make two past tense verb forms:

1. The simple (<i className="fas fa-camera" /> perfective) past
    - one time, complete actions
2. The continuous (<i className="fas fa-video" />  imperfective) past
    - continuous, ongoing, unfinished in the past

Then, we will see **what really trips people up** when learning Pashto is that <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/">the phrase structure totally changes depending on what type of verb we are using</Link>. So we will have to see how these verb forms work with both:

1. Intransitive verbs
    - verbs with no object
2. Transitive verbs
    - verbs that have an object

**First we'll introduce the two forms (simple and continuous past) using intransitive verbs**, and then later we'll see how things change when we use transitive verbs. Let's go!

## Past tense with intransitive verbs 😀

We'll start by looking at the *intransitive* verbs in the past tense because it's much simpler. The subject is the king <KingIcon /> that controls the verb and there's no weird inflection going on.

### Simple Past <i className="fas fa-camera" />

The simple past tense is used for **single, one-time, complete actions**. It's also known as the "[preterite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterite)" or "perfective past."

It uses the <i className="fas fa-camera" /> **perfective root** because it's looking at the event in the perfective aspect, as a complete whole.

<div className="text-center">
    <img src={simplePast} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

<Formula>
    Perfective root +{` `}
    <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/#past-verb-endings">Past verb ending</Link>
</Formula>

<BasicVerbShowCase opts={opts} tense="perfectivePast" />

Notice how when you can use the *short or the long* version of the roots.

### Continuous Past <i className="fas fa-video" />

The continuous past tense is used for:

- actions that were ongoing, in progress or repeated in the past
- actions that were going to happen (but didn't)
- actions that "would" happen
    - as in they *would* happen *if* ...
    - or as in they would happen regularly/habitually in the past

The continuous past uses the <i className="fas fa-video" /> **imperfective root** because it's looking at the event in the imperfective aspect, and seeing the action as in progress, ongoing, or incompleted. It's often used to set the background for other events, as in: <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "زه کور ته تلم چې...", f: "zu kor ta tlum che...", e: "I was going home when..." }} />

<Formula>
    Imperfective root +{` `}
    <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/#past-verb-endings">Past verb ending</Link>
</Formula>

<BasicVerbShowCase opts={opts} tense="imperfectivePast" />

## Past tense with transitive verbs 😵

Here's where things get interesting. <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/">Remember</Link>, with non-past tense transitive verbs the *subject* is always the king <KingIcon /> of the phrase, leaving the servant <ServantIcon /> role to the object. But **with past tense transitive verbs, the roles are reversed!** With past tense transitive verbs in Pashto:

- The **object** is the **king** <KingIcon /> of the phrase
    - The *object* commands the verb!
- The **subject** is the **servant** <ServantIcon /> of the phrase

Also, another weird thing that happens is that the **subject** is inflected.

- The **subject** gets **inflected**
- The **object** does NOT get inflected

Just when you thought you were getting the hang of things, Pashto goes ahead a deals you an uno reverse card!

</div>

This isn't just some insanity unique to Pashto. In linguistics it's known as [ergative alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive_alignment). And in Pashto this seemingly "backwards" <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/">phrase structure</Link> hits us whenever we use a past tense transitive verb.

The tenses (simple and continous past) stay the same and the formulas for making them are the same, but the <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/#3-with-past-tense-transitive-verbs-">phrase structure changes</Link>. Have a look at the examples below. Try editing them and changing the subjects and objects to see how it affects the verb. Remember, the **object is king** <KingIcon /> and the **subject inflects**.

## Habitual Past Tenses

You can add a <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "به", f: "ba" }} /> to either the simple or continuous past to talk about a <strong>habitually recurring action in the past</strong>. (Remember the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "به", f: "ba" }} /> always goes in the <KidsSection />.) The difference between the two habitual tenses *is slight*, and depends on how we view the events.

- Habitual Simple Past <i className="fas fa-camera" />
    - an event that occured and finished habitually/repeatedly
- Habitual Continuous Past <i className="fas fa-video" />
    - an event that happened habitually/repeatedly as a process or ongoing activity

### Habitual Simple Past <i className="fas fa-camera" />

With the habitual simple past (AKA habitual perfective past), we are talking about an action that was habitually repeated in the past, but we look at each event as a complete action, kind of like recurring snapshots taken with a camera. <i className="fas fa-camera" />

<div className="text-center">
    <img src={habitualSimplePast} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

<Formula>
    به - ba +{` `}
    <Link to="/verbs/past-verbs/#simple-past-i-classnamefas-fa-camera-">simple past</Link>
</Formula>

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "ما به ناوخته ډوډۍ وخوړله", f: "maa ba naawakhta DoDuy óokhoRula", e: "I would eat late", sub: "I would repeatedly/habitually eat my meals at a late time - thinking of eating the meal as a complete event that got done" },
    { p: "مونږ به دلته کېناستو", f: "moonG ba dalta kénaastoo", e: "We would sit down here", sub: "We would repeatedly/habitually sit down at this spot - thinking of the sitting down as a one-time action we did each time" }
]}</Examples>

### Habitual Continuous Past <i className="fas fa-video" />

With the habitual continuous past (AKA habitual imperfective past), we are talking about an action that was habitually repeated in the past, but we look at each event as an activity that was ongoing or happening, kind of like a a collection of video clips. <i className="fas fas-video" />

<div className="text-center">
    <img src={habitualContinuousPast} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

<Formula>
    به - ba +{` `}
    <Link to="/verbs/past-verbs/#continuous-past-i-classnamefas-fa-video-">continuous past</Link>

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "ما به ناوخته ډوډۍ خوړله", f: "maa ba naawakhta DoDuy khoRúla", e: "I would eat late", sub: "I would repeatedly/habitually eat my meals at a late time - thinking of eating as a process that happened repeatedly" },
    { p: "مونږ به دلته کېناستو", f: "moonG ba dalta kenaastóo", e: "We would sit down here", sub: "We would repeatedly/habitually sit down at this spot - thinking of the sitting down as an activity / process where we would sit together and spend time here habitually" }
]}</Examples>

The habitual continuous past is **also used to say what would happen if some condition were true.**

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    { p: "**که ته دلته وای، **مونږ به ډوډۍ خوړله", f: "ku tu dalta waay, **moonG ba DoDuy khoRúla**", e: "If you were here, **we would eat food**." },
    { p: "**که زه ستړې نه وای، **پارک ته به تلم", f: "ku zu stuRe nu waay, **paark ta ba tlum**", e: "If I (f.) wasn't tired, **I would go to the park**." }
])}</Examples>
