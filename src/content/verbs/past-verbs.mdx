Past tense verbs in Pashto are famous for being very difficult and confusing for the learner. Thankfully there are some very simple rules that we can learn, and with a little practice (ok, a *lot* of practice) you'll find there's nothing confusing about past tense verbs in Pashto at all.

Now that we're making past tense verbs, we will be using the **bottom half** of the <Link to="/verbs/roots-and-stems/">roots and stems</Link> tree.

<div style={{ maxWidth: "350px", margin: "0 auto 2rem auto" }}>
    <img src={verbTreePastPresent} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

And when we use these roots we will have to choose between the <i className="fas fa-video" /> imperfective and <i className="fas fa-camera" /> perfective aspects on the left and right sides.

<div style={{ maxWidth: "350px", margin: "0 auto 2rem auto" }}>
    <img src={verbTreeImperfectivePerfective} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

We'll use the **imperfective and perfective roots** to make two past tense verb forms:

1. The simple (<i className="fas fa-camera" /> perfective) past
    - one time, complete actions
    - formula ðŸ§ª: <samp>perfective root + <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/#past-verb-endings">past verb ending</Link></samp>
2. The continuous (<i className="fas fa-video" />  imperfective) past
    - continuous, ongoing, unfinished in the past
    - formula ðŸ§ª: <samp>imperfective root + <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/#past-verb-endings">past verb ending</Link></samp>

Then, we will see **what really trips people up** when learning Pashto is that <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/">the phrase structure totally changes depending on what type of verb we are using</Link>. So we will have to see how these verb forms work with both:

1. Intransitive verbs
    - verbs with no object
2. Transitive verbs
    - verbs that have an object

**First we'll introduce the two forms (simple and continuous past) using intransitive verbs**, and then later we'll see how things change when we use transitive verbs. Let's go!

## Past tense with intransitive verbs

### Simple Past

<Formula>
    Perfective root +{` `}
    <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/#past-verb-endings">Past verb ending</Link>
</Formula>

<BasicVerbShowCase opts={opts} tense="perfectivePast" />

### Continuous Past

<Formula>
    Imperfective root +{` `}
    <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/#past-verb-endings">Past verb ending</Link>
</Formula>

<BasicVerbShowCase opts={opts} tense="imperfectivePast" />

## Past Tense with Transitive Verbs

Here's where things get interesting. With non-past tense verbs the *subject* is the <KingIcon /> king of the phrase, leaving the <ServantIcon /> servant role to the object. But with past tense transitive verbs, the roles are reversed! With past tense transitive verbs in Pashto:

- The **object** is the <KingIcon /> **king** of the phrase
    - The *object* commands the verb!
- The **subject** is the <ServantIcon /> **servant** of the phrase

Also, another weird thing that happens is that the **subject** is inflected.

- The **subject** gets **inflected**
- The **object** does NOT get inflected

This isn't just some insanity unique to Pashto, in linguistics it's known as [ergative alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive_alignment). And in Pashto this seemingly "backwards" <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/">phrase structure</Link> hits us whenever we use a past tense transitive verb.
