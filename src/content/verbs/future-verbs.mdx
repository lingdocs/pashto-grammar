There are two kinds of future forms in Pashto:

2. <i className="fas fa-video" /> Imperfective Future
1. <i className="fas fa-camera" /> Perfective Future

## Imperfective Future

This is used to talk about something happening in the future, while thinking of the event as an ongoing or recurring event. It can also be used to stress the certainty of the event happening. 

<div className="text-center">
    <img src={imperfectiveFuture} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "به", f: "ba" }} /> +{` `}
    <Link to="/verbs/present-verbs/">Present</Link>
</Formula>

<BasicVerbShowCase opts={opts} tense="imperfectiveFuture" />

Notice that the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "به", f: "ba" }} /> goes in the <KidsSection />.

## Perfective Future

This is used to talk about something happening in the future, while thinking of the event *as a whole* or as a one time event. It can also be used when there is a little less certainty that the event will happen.

<div className="text-center">
    <img src={perfectiveFuture} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "به", f: "ba" }} /> +{` `}
    <Link to="/verbs/subjunctive-verbs/">Subjunctive</Link>
</Formula>

<BasicVerbShowCase opts={opts} tense="perfectiveFuture" />
