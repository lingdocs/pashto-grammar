## Introduction

We use [perfect tenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)) when we want to **emphasize the consequences** of an event or **focus on the resulting state** after the event.

> A perfect tense (abbreviated perf or prf) is a grammatical form used to describe a past event with present relevance, or a present state resulting from a past situation. For example, “I have put it on the table” implies both that I put the object on the table and that it is still there; “I have been to France” conveys that this is a part of my experience as of now; and “I have lost my wallet” implies that this loss is troublesome at the present moment. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfective_aspect#Perfective_vs._perfect))

<div className="alert alert-warning">

**Note** ⚠️: This is *not* to be confused with the <Link to="/verbs/verb-aspect/#i-classnamefas-fa-camera--perfective-aspect">perfective aspect</Link> <Camera />, which is a totally different thing.

</div>

In English we're not as strict with using the perfect tense. In fact it can sound a little formal or bookish to always say things like "I've lost my wallet" (perfect) instead of "I lost my wallet" (simple past). In Pashto however, this distinction is very normal and common, and you will see the perfect form used whenever it's important to talk about a state resulting from the action.

### Comparing Simple Past to Perfect

With the <Link to="/verbs/past-verbs/#simple-past-i-classnamefas-fa-camera-">simple past tense</Link> we're talking about an event happening. We're just relaying the fact that something happened, without talking about the consequences of that event.

<div style={{ maxWidth: "350px", margin: "0 auto 2rem auto" }}>
    <img src={simplePast} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

<Examples opts={opts}>
    {[
        {
            p: "ما ډوډۍ وخوړله",
            f: "maa DoDúy óokhoRula",
            e: "I ate food (simple past)",
            sub: "meaning: I chewed and swallowed the food."
        }
    ]}
</Examples>

With a **perfect** tense, we're talking about the **result of an event**. We're saying that something has happened, and therefore there's an effect on the situation.

<div style={{ maxWidth: "350px", margin: "0 auto 2rem auto" }}>
    <img src={presentPerfect} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

<Examples opts={opts}>
    {[
        {
            p: "ما ډوډۍ خوړلې ده",
            f: "maa DoDúy khoRúle da",
            e: "I've eaten food (perfect)",
            sub: "meaning: I am full now."
        }
    ]}
</Examples>

## How to make perfect tenses 🧪

Earlier we talked about how <EP text="equatives" /> and <VP text="verbs" /> are totally different in Pashto. Well now we're going to do something very crazy. To make the perfect forms we are going to **combine verbs and equatives**. 👨🏻‍🔬😮

<div style={{ maxWidth: "350px", margin: "0 auto 2rem auto" }}>
    <img src={chemistryPerfect} alt="" className="img-fluid" />
</div>

<Formula>
    <Link to="/verbs/roots-and-stems/#the-past-participle">Verb Past Participle</Link> +{` `}
    Equative = Perfect
</Formula>

To make the perfect forms we take the <Link to="/verbs/roots-and-stems/#the-past-participle">past participle</Link> of the verb and **add an equative block** next to it. For example, with the verb <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "تلل", f: "tlul", e: "to go" }} /> we could say:

<EditableVPEx opts={opts} mode="blocks">
    {
        {"blocks":[{"key":0.9450165572504559,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":0,"distance":"far"}}}},{"key":0.9846690662896809,"block":{"type":"objectSelection","selection":"none"}}],"verb":{"type":"verb","verb":{"entry":{"ts":1527815348,"i":3656,"p":"تلل","f":"tlul","g":"tlul","e":"to go","c":"v. intrans. irreg.","psp":"ځ","psf":"dz","ssp":"لاړ ش","ssf":"láaR sh","prp":"لاړ","prf":"láaR","ec":"go,goes,going,went,gone"}},"verbTense":"perfectivePast","perfectTense":"presentPerfect","imperativeTense":"imperfectiveImperative","tenseCategory":"perfect","transitivity":"intransitive","isCompound":false,"voice":"active","negative":false,"canChangeTransitivity":false,"canChangeVoice":false,"canChangeStatDyn":false},"form":{"removeKing":false,"shrinkServant":false}}
    }
</EditableVPEx>

Now instead of one verb block, we have **two blocks** that have to agree with the king <KingIcon /> of the <VP />.

1. The **past participle** <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "تللی", f: "tlúley" }} />
2. The **equative** <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "یم", f: "yum", e: "" }} />

Both of these need to agree with the king <KingIcon />. To do that we need to:

1. Inflect the past participle
2. Choose the right equative

### Inflecting the Past Participle

The past participle will always follow the <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#2-words-ending-in-an-unstressed-inlineps-optsopts-ps-p-ی-f-ey--">#2 inflection pattern</Link> because it ends with an unstressed <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ی", f: "ey", e: "" }} />. So, depending on what the king <KingIcon /> is you need to choose the right inflection to agree with the gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural) of the king.

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col">Masculine</th>
      <th scope="col">Feminine</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Singular (Plain)</th>
      <td>
        <div>
            <Pashto opts={opts}>{{ p: "تللی", f: "tlúley" }}</Pashto>
        </div>
        <div>
            <Phonetics opts={opts}>{{ p: "تللی", f: "tlúley" }}</Phonetics>
        </div>
      </td>
      <td>
        <div>
            <Pashto opts={opts}>{{ p: "تللې", f: "tlúle" }}</Pashto>
        </div>
        <div>
            <Phonetics opts={opts}>{{ p: "تللې", f: "tlúle" }}</Phonetics>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Plural (Inflected)</th>
      <td>
        <div>
            <Pashto opts={opts}>{{ p: "تللي", f: "tlúlee" }}</Pashto>
        </div>
        <div>
            <Phonetics opts={opts}>{{ p: "تللي", f: "tlúlee" }}</Phonetics>
        </div>
      </td>
      <td>
        <div>
            <Pashto opts={opts}>{{ p: "تللې", f: "tlúle" }}</Pashto>
        </div>
        <div>
            <Phonetics opts={opts}>{{ p: "تللې", f: "tlúle" }}</Phonetics>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

So this sentence will change slightly if a woman says it.

<EditableVPEx opts={opts} mode="blocks">
    {
        {"blocks":[{"key":0.9450165572504559,"block":{"type":"subjectSelection","selection":{"type":"NP","selection":{"type":"pronoun","person":1,"distance":"far"}}}},{"key":0.9846690662896809,"block":{"type":"objectSelection","selection":"none"}}],"verb":{"type":"verb","verb":{"entry":{"ts":1527815348,"i":3656,"p":"تلل","f":"tlul","g":"tlul","e":"to go","c":"v. intrans. irreg.","psp":"ځ","psf":"dz","ssp":"لاړ ش","ssf":"láaR sh","prp":"لاړ","prf":"láaR","ec":"go,goes,going,went,gone"}},"verbTense":"perfectivePast","perfectTense":"presentPerfect","imperativeTense":"imperfectiveImperative","tenseCategory":"perfect","transitivity":"intransitive","isCompound":false,"voice":"active","negative":false,"canChangeTransitivity":false,"canChangeVoice":false,"canChangeStatDyn":false},"form":{"removeKing":false,"shrinkServant":false}}
    }
</EditableVPEx>

In that case the king, <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "زه", f: "zu", e: "I" }} />, will be *feminine*, so:

1. The **past participle** <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "تللی", f: "tlúley" }} /> will be given the <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#2-words-ending-in-an-unstressed-inlineps-optsopts-ps-p-ی-f-ey--">feminine form</Link> <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "تللې", f: "tlúle", e: "" }} /> because it agrees with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "زه", f: "zu", e: "I (f.)" }} /> which is feminine singular.
2. The **equative** <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "یم", f: "yum", e: "" }} /> stays the same.

How would we say "*We* have gone" ? Try to make this sentence by making the two blocks agree with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "مونږ", f: "moonG" }} />.

1. Inflect the **past participle** <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "تللی", f: "tluley" }} />
2. Choose the right equative

Actually the answer changes depending on whether the "we" in masculine or feminine! (Mixed groups are always considered masculine.) Press the <EditIcon /> above the answer and adjust it to see how it changes when you use a feminine "we."

Let's look at some examples of other intransitive verbs with all the different persons:

<BasicVerbShowCase opts={opts} tense="presentPerfect" />

That seems like a pretty intimidating chart! But it gets simpler if we remember that we are just making the two blocks (past participle and equative) agree with the king <KingIcon /> of the phrase. Also notice how there's a pattern with the participle inflection that repeats every two lines. 🤓 

## Examples

Have a look at the examples below, and notice how both the past participle and the equative blocks agree with the king of the phrase. **Perfects are considered past-tense** so they will follow the <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/">same VP structure</Link> as other past tense forms, meaning that:

- with **intransitive** verbs the *subject is king*
- with **transitive** verbs the *object is king*

Also, you can <Link to="/phrase-structure/shortening-vps/">shorten these VPs</Link> in the same way as you do with other verb forms, but you may notice some interesting changes because with the perfect there are <Link to="/verbs/perfect-verbs/#how-to-make-perfect-tenses-">two verb blocks</Link>.

### Transitive Examples

With transitive verbs everything works the same, but we follow the <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/#3-with-past-tense-transitive-verbs-">VP structure for past-tense transitive verbs</Link> meaning that now:

1. The subject will inflect
2. The *object* is king <KingIcon />
    - The two verb blocks (past participle and equative) will agree with the *object*

## Negatives with the perfect

To make perfect forms negative you add a <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "نه", f: "nú", e: "" }} /> block, just as you would with any other verb. But interestingly, **the past participle and equative blocks switch places**.

You can also say the negative without swapping the order of the past participle and equative, for example <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "زه تللی نه یم", f: "zu tlúley nú yum" }} /> but that makes it more emphatically negative, kind of like if you were to say, "I have **NOT** gone" in a loud voice.

Try editing the <Link to="#examples">examples above</Link> and making them negative. Notice how the different forms <Link to="/phrase-structure/shortening-vps/">are shortened</Link> with the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "نه", f: "nú", e: "" }} /> block in there.

## Other forms of perfect

So far we have only made perfect forms using the <Link to="/equatives/present-equative/">present equative</Link>. This form with the present equative is called the **present perfect** because it's talking about things that happened in the past but **have an effect on the present situation**. But actually, we can use any of the <Link to="/equatives/other-equatives/#overview-of-8-equatives">8 equatives</Link> with the perfect which gives a whole new gamut of expressive super-powers. 💪  <Link to="/verbs/all-perfect-verbs/">Read on</Link>...
