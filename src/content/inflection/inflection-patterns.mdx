In the <Link to="/inflection/inflection-intro/">previous chapter</Link> we talked about **why** words inflect. Now we will explain **how** words inflect. What actualy happens to them? How do they change?

Like many things in Pashto, inflection can seem mysterious and intimidating. Why do the words change so much, and how!? 😩 But, we'll see that there are just a few basic patterns that the words follow, and it's not so scary or confusing after all.

Below are the **5 basic patterns for inflecting** nouns and adjectives. Notice how all these patterns work with both masculine and feminine genders.

Don't worry about memorizing them all perfectly to start. Instead keep looking back and use them as guides to help you as you get familiar with the inflections over time.

## 1. Basic

These words always end in:

- **Masculine:** - consonant or a shwa (<InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-u" }} /> vowel)
- **Feminine:** - <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} />

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(isPattern1Entry),
    "غټ",
)} />

<details>

<summary>
<strong>Note</strong>: In sandwiches like <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "په ... کې", f: "pu ... ke" }} /> describing <strong>location</strong> the first inflection of *feminine nouns* in this pattern is not used.
</summary>
    
For example using the word <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "کوټه", f: "koTá", e: "room" }} />:

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "زه **په کوټه کې** ناست یم",
        f: "zu **pu koTá ke** naast yum",
        e: "I am sitting **in the room**.",
    }
])}</Examples>

In any other kind of sandwich the first inflection would be used.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "زه **کوټې ته** ځم",
        f: "zu **koTé ta** dzum",
        e: "I'm going to the room",
    },
])}</Examples>

</details>

## 2. Words ending in an unstressed <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ی", f: "ey" }} />

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(isPattern2Entry),
    "ستړی",
)} />  

## 3. Words ending in a stressed <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ی", f: "éy" }} />

This is very similar to pattern #2, but with the stress on the last syllable the feminine inflection changes.

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(isPattern3Entry),
    "لومړی",
)} />  

## 4. Words with the "Pashtoon" pattern

These words are a little irregular but you can see a common patten based around:

- lengthening the 1st masculine inflection with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ا ـ ـه", f: "aa _ u" }} />
- shortening the other forms and adding the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} />, <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـې", f: "-e" }} />, <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـو", f: "-o" }} /> endings

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(isPattern4Entry),
    "پښتون",
)} />

**Note**: 

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Note</strong>: <strong>Masculine nimate nouns</strong> in this pattern will often only use the first inflection for the plural.
</summary>

For example, if we put a singular masculine animate word <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "پښټون", f: "puxtoon" }} /> in a sandwich, most of the time people will not inflect it.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "**د پښتون** نوم څه دی؟",
        f: "**du puxtoon** noom tsu dey?",
        e: "What is the **Pashtun's** name",
    }
])}</Examples>

But it will of course inflect for the plural.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "دلته **پښتانه** اوسېږي",
        f: "dalta **puxtaanu** oseGee",
        e: "**Pashtuns** live here",
    },
    {
        p: "دا **د پښتنو** رواج دی",
        f: "daa **du puxtano** rawaaj dey",
        e: "This is **the Pashtuns'** custom"
    },
])}</Examples>

</details>

## 5. Shorter words that squish

These are also a little irregular but instead of lengthening the 1st masculine inflection they compress it as well and take just an <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-u" }} /> on the end.

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(isPattern5Entry),
    "غل",
)} />  

## Not all words inflect

It's important to know that *not all words can be inflected*. If a word doesn't fit into one of these 5 patterns, you can't inflect it. For example, if an adjective ends in an <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} /> in the masculine form, you can't inflect it because it doesn't fit any of the patterns above. 🙅‍♂️

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "خفه", f: "khufa", e: "sad", sub: "...is also sad because it can't inflect like all the other words 😢" },
]}</Examples>
