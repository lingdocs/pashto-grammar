In the <Link to="/inflection/inflection-intro/">previous chapter</Link> we talked about **why** words inflect. Now we will explain **how** words inflect. What actualy happens to them? How do they change?

Like many things in Pashto, inflection can seem mysterious and intimidating. Why do the words change so much, and how!? 😩 But, we'll see that there are just a few basic patterns that the words follow, and it's not so scary or confusing after all.

Below are the **6 basic patterns for inflecting** nouns and adjectives. Notice how all these patterns work with both masculine and feminine genders.

Don't worry about memorizing them all perfectly to start. Instead keep looking back and use them as guides to help you as you get familiar with the inflections over time.

## 1. Basic

These words always end in:

- **Masculine:** - consonant or a shwa (<InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-u" }} /> vowel)
- **Feminine:** - <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} />

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(tp.isPattern1Entry),
    "غټ",
)} />

**Note:** See <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#pattern-1-words-in-sandwiches-starting-with-inlineps-optsopts-ps-p-په-f-pu--">exception</Link> below.

## 2. Words ending in an unstressed ی - ey

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(tp.isPattern2Entry),
    "ستړی",
)} />  

## 3. Words ending in a stressed ی - éy

This is very similar to pattern #2, but with the stress on the last syllable the feminine inflection changes.

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(tp.isPattern3Entry),
    "لومړی",
)} />  

## 4. Words with the "Pashtoon" pattern

These words are a little irregular but you can see a common patten based around:

- lengthening the 1st masculine inflection with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ا ـ ـه", f: "aa _ u" }} />
- shortening the other forms and adding the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} />, <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـې", f: "-e" }} />, <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـو", f: "-o" }} /> endings

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(tp.isPattern4Entry),
    "پښتون",
)} />

**Note:** See <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#pattern-4-masculine-animate-nouns">exception</Link> below.

## 5. Shorter words that squish

These are also a little irregular but instead of lengthening the 1st masculine inflection they compress it as well and take just an <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-u" }} /> on the end.

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(
    words.filter(tp.isPattern5Entry),
    "غل",
)} /> 

## 6. Inanimate feminine nouns ending in ي - ee

There is one more pattern which only works for **inanimate feminine nouns ending in <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ي", f: "ee", e: "" }} />**.

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(femNouns.filter(tp.isPattern6FemEntry), "آزادي")} />

Animate nouns like <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "بي بي", f: "beebee", e: "grandmother" }} /> will not inflect like this, and masculine nouns like <InlinePs ps={{ p: "قاضي", f: "qaazee", e: "judge" }} opts={opts} /> also will not inflect.

## Not all words inflect

It's important to know that *not all words can be inflected*. If a word doesn't fit into one of these 6 patterns, you can't inflect it. For example, if an adjective ends in an <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} /> in the masculine form, you can't inflect it because it doesn't fit any of the patterns above. 🙅‍♂️

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "خفه", f: "khufa", e: "sad", sub: "...is also sad because it can't inflect like all the other words 😢" },
]}</Examples>

## Exceptions

Whatever kind of word you're using, it will always inflect for the <Link to="/inflection/inflection-intro/">three reasons</Link> that we mentioned earlier. However, there are two big exceptions. 

### Pattern 1 words in sandwiches starting with په - pu

When you put a <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#1-basic">pattern 1 - basic</Link> word in a the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "په ... کې", f: "pu ... ke", e: "in" }} /> sandwich, **it will not use the first inflection**.

For example, let's put the word <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "کوټه", f: "koTa", e: "room" }} /> inside the sandwich <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "په ... کې", f: "pu ... ke", e: "in" }} />. It doesn't inflect!

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    { p: "زه **په کوټه کې** یم", f: "zu **pu koTa ke** yum", e: "I am **in the room**" },
])}</Examples>

But if you make it plural, it *will* use the second inflection. Only the first inflection is skipped.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    { p: "مونږ **په کوټو کې** یو", f: "moonG **pu koTo ke** yoo", e: "We are **in the rooms**" },
])}</Examples>

Remember that in any other kind of sandwich, you still use the first inflection with these pattern 1 words.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "زه **کوټې ته** ځم",
        f: "zu **koTé ta** dzum",
        e: "I'm going to the room",
    },
])}</Examples>

Other sandwiches starting with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "په", f: "pu" }} /> like <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "په ... باندې", f: "pu ... baande" }} /> are a bit flexible with these pattern 1 words. Sometimes people will inflect them and sometimes they won't.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    { p: "هغه **په ښځه باندې** ډوډۍ پخوي", f: "hagha **pu xudza baande** DoDuy pakhawee", e: "He gets his wife to cook the food", sub: "not inflected" },
    { p: "هغه **په ښځې باندې** ډوډۍ پخوي", f: "hagha **pu xudze baande** DoDuy pakhawee", e: "He gets his wife to cook the food", sub: "inflected" },
])}</Examples>

### Pattern 4 masculine animate nouns

<p><Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#4-words-with-the-pashtoon-pattern">Pattern 4</Link> <strong>masculine animate nouns</strong> (ie. a person or animal) in this pattern will often <strong>only use the first inflection for the plural</strong>. (In some dialects and formal written text though, they will still use the inflection for all three reasons.)</p>

#### In sandwiches

For example, if we put the the singular word <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "پښټون", f: "puxtoon" }} /> in a sandwich, *usually* people will not inflect it.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "زه **له پښتون سره** ناست یم",
        f: "zu **la puxtoon sara** naast yum",
        e: "I'm (m.) sitting **with the Pashtun** (m.)",
        sub: "masc - not inflected",
    },
    {
        p: "زه **له پښتنې سره** ناسته یم",
        f: "zu **la puxtane sara** naasta yum",
        e: "I'm (f.) sitting **with the Pashtun** (f.)",
        sub: "fem - inflected",
    },
    {
        p: "**د پښتون** نوم څه دی؟",
        f: "**du puxtoon** (m.) noom tsu dey?",
        e: "What is the **Pashtun's** (m.) name",
        sub: "masc - not inflected",
    },
    {
        p: "زه **له پښتنو سره** ناست یم",
        f: "zu **la puxtano sara** naast yum",
        e: "I'm sitting **with the Pashtuns**",
    },
    {
        p: "**د پښتنو** نومونه څه دی؟",
        f: "**du puxtano** noomoona tsu dee?",
        e: "What are the **Pashtun's** names",
    },
])}</Examples>

#### As subjects of past tense transitive verbs

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "**پښتون** زه ولیدم",
        f: "**puxtoon** zu óoledum",
        e: "The Pashtun saw me",
        sub: "not inflected",
    },
    {
        p: "**پښتنو** زه ولیدم",
        f: "**puxtano** zu óoledum",
        e: "The Pashtuns saw me",
    },
])}</Examples>

#### Plural

But these words will *always* use the first inflection for the plural.

<Examples opts={opts}>{psmd([
    {
        p: "دلته **پښتانه** اوسېږي",
        f: "dalta **puxtaanu** oseGee",
        e: "**Pashtuns** live here",
    },
    {
        p: "دا **د پښتنو** رواج دی",
        f: "daa **du puxtano** rawaaj dey",
        e: "This is **the Pashtuns'** custom"
    },
])}</Examples>
