In the <Link to="/inflection/inflection-intro/">previous chapter</Link> we talked about **why** words inflect. Now we will explain **how** words inflect. What actualy happens to them? How do they change?

Like many things in Pashto, inflection can seem mysterious and intimidating. Why do the words change so much, and how!? 😩 But, we'll see that there are just a few basic patterns that the words follow, and it's not so scary or confusing after all.

Below are the **6 basic patterns for inflecting** nouns and adjectives. Notice how all these patterns work with both masculine and feminine genders.

Don't worry about memorizing them all perfectly to start. Instead keep looking back and use them as guides to help you as you get familiar with the inflections over time.

## 1. Basic

These words always end in:

- **Masculine:** - consonant or a shwa (<InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-u" }} /> vowel)
- **Feminine:** - <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} />

<InflectionCarousel
  items={startingWord(words.filter(tp.isPattern1Entry), "غټ")}
/>

**Note:** See <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#pattern-1-words-in-sandwiches-starting-with-inlineps-optsopts-ps-p-په-f-pu--">exception</Link> below.

## 2. Words ending in an unstressed ی - ay

<InflectionCarousel
  items={startingWord(words.filter(tp.isPattern2Entry), "ستړی")}
/>{" "}

## 3. Words ending in a stressed ی - áy

This is very similar to pattern #2, but with the stress on the last syllable the feminine inflection changes.

<InflectionCarousel
  items={startingWord(words.filter(tp.isPattern3Entry), "لومړی")}
/>{" "}

## 4. Words with the "Pashtoon" pattern

These words are a little irregular but you can see a common patten based around:

- lengthening the 1st masculine inflection with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ا ـ ـه", f: "aa _ u" }} />
- shortening the other forms and adding the <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} />, <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـې", f: "-e" }} />, <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـو", f: "-o" }} /> endings

<InflectionCarousel
  items={startingWord(words.filter(tp.isPattern4Entry), "پښتون")}
/>

**Note:** See <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#pattern-4-masculine-animate-nouns">exception</Link> below.

## 5. Shorter words that squish

These are also a little irregular but instead of lengthening the 1st masculine inflection they compress it as well and take just an <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-u" }} /> on the end.

<InflectionCarousel
  items={startingWord(words.filter(tp.isPattern5Entry), "غل")}
/>{" "}

## 6. Inanimate feminine nouns ending in ي - ee

There is one more pattern which only works for **inanimate feminine nouns ending in <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ي", f: "ee", e: "" }} />**.

<InflectionCarousel
  items={startingWord(femNouns.filter(tp.isPattern6FemEntry), "آزادي")}
/>

Animate nouns like <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "بي بي", f: "beebee", e: "grandmother" }} /> will not inflect like this, and masculine nouns like <InlinePs ps={{ p: "قاضي", f: "qaazee", e: "judge" }} opts={opts} /> also will not inflect.

## Not all words inflect

It's important to know that _not all words can be inflected_. If a word doesn't fit into one of these 6 patterns, you can't inflect it. For example, if an adjective ends in an <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ـه", f: "-a" }} /> in the masculine form, you can't inflect it because it doesn't fit any of the patterns above. 🙅‍♂️

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {[
    {
      p: "خفه",
      f: "khufa",
      e: "sad",
      sub: "...is also sad because it can't inflect like all the other words 😢",
    },
  ]}
</Examples>

## Exceptions

Whatever kind of word you're using, it will always inflect for the <Link to="/inflection/inflection-intro/">three reasons</Link> that we mentioned earlier. However, there are a few exceptions.

### Pattern 1 words in sandwiches starting with په - pu

When you put a <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/#1-basic">pattern 1 - basic</Link> word in a sandwich starting with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "په ...", f: "pu ..." }} /> sandwich, the first inflection is optional. Some people will use it, some will not.

For example:

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "زه **په کوټه کې** یم",
      f: "zu **pu koTa ke** yum",
      e: "I am **in the room**",
    },   
    {
      p: "زه **په کوټې کې** یم",
      f: "zu **pu koTe ke** yum",
      e: "I am **in the room**",
    },
    {
      p: "هغه **په ښځه باندې** ډوډۍ پخوي",
      f: "hagha **pu xudza baande** DoDuy pakhawee",
      e: "He gets his wife to cook the food",
      sub: "not inflected",
    },
    {
      p: "هغه **په ښځې باندې** ډوډۍ پخوي",
      f: "hagha **pu xudze baande** DoDuy pakhawee",
      e: "He gets his wife to cook the food",
      sub: "inflected",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

But if you make it plural, it will always use the second inflection. Only the first inflection is skipped.

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "مونږ **په کوټو کې** یو",
      f: "moonG **pu koTo ke** yoo",
      e: "We are **in the rooms**",
    },
    {
      p: "هغه **په ښځو باندې** ډوډۍ پخوي",
      f: "hagha **pu xudzo baande** DoDuy pakhawee",
      e: "He gets his wives to cook the food",
      sub: "not inflected",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

Remember that in any other kind of sandwich, you will _always_ use the first inflection with these pattern 1 words. They are only optional with sandwiches starting with <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "په ...", f: "pu ..." }} />. 

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "زه **کوټې ته** ځم",
      f: "zu **koTé ta** dzum",
      e: "I'm going to the room",
    },
    {
      p: "❌ زه **کوټه ته** ځم ❌",
      f: "❌ zu **koTá ta** dzum ❌",
      e: "I'm going to the room",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

### Pattern 4 masculine animate nouns

Pattern 4 <strong>masculine animate nouns</strong> (ie. a person or animal) in this pattern will often <strong>only use the first inflection for the plural</strong>. Some people will use the first inflection for all three reasons, but most will not.

#### In sandwiches

For example, if we put the the masculine singular word <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "پښټون", f: "puxtoon" }} /> in a sandwich, _usually_ people will not inflect it. But the feminine form will always inflect.

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "زه **له پښتون سره** ناست یم",
      f: "zu **la puxtoon sara** naast yum",
      e: "I'm (m.) sitting **with the Pashtun** (m.)",
      sub: "masc. not inflected for sandwich",
    },
    {
      p: "زه **له پښتنې سره** ناسته یم",
      f: "zu **la puxtane sara** naasta yum",
      e: "I'm (f.) sitting **with the Pashtun** (f.)",
      sub: "fem. inflected for sandwich",
    },
    {
      p: "**د پښتون** نوم څه دی؟",
      f: "**du puxtoon** (m.) noom tsu day?",
      e: "What is the **Pashtun's** (m.) name",
      sub: "masc. not inflected for sandwich",
    },
    {
      p: "زه **له پښتنو سره** ناست یم",
      f: "zu **la puxtano sara** naast yum",
      e: "I'm sitting **with the Pashtuns**",
      sub: "double inflected for plural and sandwich",
    },
    {
      p: "**د پښتنو** نومونه څه دی؟",
      f: "**du puxtano** noomoona tsu dee?",
      e: "What are the **Pashtun's** names",
      sub: "double inflected for plural and sandwich",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### As subjects of past tense transitive verbs

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "**پښتون** زه ولیدم",
      f: "**puxtoon** zu óoledum",
      e: "The Pashtun (m.) saw me",
      sub: "masc. not inflected for subject of past-tense trans.",
    },
    {
      p: "**پښتنې** زه ولیدم",
      f: "**puxtané** zu óoledum",
      e: "The Pashtun (f.) saw me",
      sub: "fem. inflected for subject of past-tense trans.",
    },
    {
      p: "**پښتنو** زه ولیدم",
      f: "**puxtano** zu óoledum",
      e: "The Pashtuns saw me",
      sub: "double inflected for plural and subject of past-tense trans."
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

#### Plural

But these words will _always_ use the first inflection for the plural.

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "دلته **پښتانه** اوسېږي",
      f: "dalta **puxtaanu** oseGee",
      e: "**Pashtuns** live here",
      sub: "masc. inflected for plural",
    },
    {
      p: "دا **د پښتنو** رواج دی",
      f: "daa **du puxtano** rawaaj day",
      e: "This is **the Pashtuns'** custom",
      sub: "double inflected for plural and sandwich",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

### Pattern 4 masculine animate unusual nouns

There are a few words that don't perfectly fit the "Pashtoon" pattern. For example:

- <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "مېلمه", f: "melmá", e: "guest" }} />
- <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "کوربه", f: "korbá", e: "host" }} />

When masculine, these words will only use the first inflection for plurals. They will not use the first inflection for sandwiches or for subjects of transitive past tense words. For example:

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "مېلمانه ناست دي",
      f: "melmaanú naast dee",
      e: "The guests are sitting",
      sub: "masc. inflected for plural"
    },
    {
      p: "د مېلمه نوم څه دی؟",
      f: "du melmá noom tsu day?",
      e: "What is the guest's (m.) name?",
      sub: "masc. not inflected for sandwich"
    },
    {
      p: "د مېلمنې نوم څه دی",
      f: "du melmané noom tsu day?",
      e: "What is the guest's (f.) name?",
      sub: "fem. inflected for sandwich"
    },
    {
      p: "مېلمنو نومونه څه دي",
      f: "du melmanó noomoona tsu dee?",
      e: "What are the guests' names?",
      sub: "double inflected for plural and sandwich"
    },
    {
      p: "مېلمه زه ولیدم",
      f: "melmá zu óoleedum",
      e: "The guest (m.) saw me",
      sub: "masc. not inflected for subject of past-tense trans."
    },
    {
      p: "مېلمنې زه ولیدم",
      f: "melmané zu óoleedum",
      e: "The guest (f.) saw me",
      sub: "fem. inflected for subject of past-tense trans."
    },
    {
      p: "مېلمنو زه ولیدم",
      f: "melmano zu óoleedum",
      e: "The guests saw me",
      sub: "double inflected for plural and subject of past-tense trans."
    },
  ])}
</Examples>
