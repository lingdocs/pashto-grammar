The <Link to="/inflection/inflection-patterns/">5 basic patterns in the last chapter</Link> work with both masculine and feminine words (nouns and adjectives).

There are also a few more patterns that are only for **feminine nouns**.

## Feminine Nouns Ending in <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ي", f: "ee" }} /> 

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(words, "ee-fem-noun", "آزادي")} />

**Note:** This only works with **inanimate nouns**. (ie. words for people like <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "باجي", f: "baajée", e: "older sister" }} /> will not inflect like this.)


## Feminine Nouns Ending in <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ۍ", f: "uy" }} />

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(words, "uy-fem-noun", "هګۍ")} />

## Feminine Nouns Ending in <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ا", f: "aa" }} />  

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(words, "aa-fem-noun", "وینا")} />

**Note:** With this pattern, the first inflection is often only used for making the noun plural. Also, many dialects use the plural <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ګانې", f: "gáane" }} /> ending instead. For instance:

<Table headRow={["Standard", "Common"]} opts={opts}>{[
    [
        { p: "دعا", f: "dUáa", e: "prayer" },
        { p: "دعا", f: "dUáa", e: "prayer" },
    ],
    [
        { p: "دعاوې", f: "dUáawe", e: "prayers" },
        { p: "دعا ګانې", f: "dUaa gáane", e: "prayers" },
    ],
    [
        { p: "دعا ګانو", f: "dUáawo", e: "prayers", sub: "with second inflection" },
        { p: "دعا ګانې", f: "dUaa gáano", e: "prayers", sub: "with second inflection" },
    ],
]}</Table>
