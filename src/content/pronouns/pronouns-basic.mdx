## Far Pronouns

These pronouns are used to reference people or things that are far.

<PronounInflectionChoice pronouns={grammarUnits.pronouns.far} far />

## Near Pronouns

These pronouns are used to reference people or things that are close (either physically close or close in conversation).

Notice that only the third person pronouns are different from the far pronouns.

<PronounInflectionChoice pronouns={grammarUnits.pronouns.near} />

## Inflecting Pronouns

Since there are singular and plural versions of pronouns, pronouns will not inflect for being plural. But the singular pronouns will inflect for the other two reasons:

- being the subject of a past tense transitive verb
- being in a sandwich

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "**هغې** زه ولیدم.",
      f: "**haghé** zu óoleedum.",
      e: "**She** saw me",
      sub: "Inflected because 'she' is the subject of a past tense transitive verb.",
    },
    {
      p: "زه له **ده** سره خبرې کوم.",
      f: "zu la **dú** sara khabúre kawúm.",
      e: "I'm talking with **him**.",
      sub: "Inflected because 'he' is in a sandwich.",
    },
  ])}
</Examples>

### ⚠️ Inflecting 1st/2nd Person Pronouns ⚠️

Normally <Link to="/phrase-structure/vp/">the object of transitive verbs never inflects</Link>. But **1st and 2nd person pronouns (I, you) are an exception**. 1st and 2nd person pronouns (I, you) will inflect if they are the object of a present/future tense verb. The **3rd person pronouns, however, do NOT inflect as objects.**

The only time you ever inflect an object in Pashto:

- The object is a 1st or 2nd person pronoun (not 3rd!)
- The verb is not past tense

This is tricky for English speakers to remember, because in English we inflect all 1st and 3rd person pronouns when they are objects. For example, we say "he sees **me**," and "I see **him**." _In Pashto we have to say "he sees **me**" and "I see **he**."_

#### When do you inflect an object in Pashto?

<Table
  opts={opts}
  headRow={["", "object is a 1st/2nd pers. pronoun", "object is anything else"]}
>
  {[
    ["verb is past tense", "❌", "❌"],
    ["verb is not past tense", "✅", "❌"],
  ]}
</Table>

<Examples opts={opts}>
  {psmd([
    {
      p: "زه **تا** وینم.",
      f: "zu **taa** wéenum.",
      e: "I see **you**. (obj.)",
      sub: "Inflected 2nd pers. pronoun",
    },
    {
      p: "ما **ته** ولیدلې.",
      f: "maa **tu** óoleedule.",
      e: "I saw **you**. (obj.)",
      sub: "Object is **not** inflected, because this is past tense",
    },
    {
      p: "ته **ما** وینې.",
      f: "tu **maa** wéene.",
      e: "You see **me**. (obj.)",
      sub: "Inflected 1st pers. pronoun",
    },
    {
      p: "زه **هغه** وینم.",
      f: "zu **haghá** wéenum.",
      e: "I see **her**. (obj.)",
      sub: "3rd pers. pronoun is **not** inflected",
    },
    {
      p: "❌ زه **هغې** وینم.",
      f: "❌ zu **haghé** wéenum.",
      e: "I see **her**. (obj.)",
      sub: "3rd pers. pronoun should **not** inflect here",
    },
    {
      p: "**ما** مه وهه!",
      f: "**maa** mú wahá!",
      e: "Don't hit **me**! (obj.)",
      sub: "Inflected 1st pers. pronoun",
    },
    {
      p: "**دی** مه وهه!",
      f: "**day** mú wahá!",
      e: "Don't hit **him**! (obj.)",
      sub: "3rd pers. pronoun is **not** inflected",
